# Jun Kazama TEKKEN 7 Moveset Mod
Jun Kazama's TAG2 moveset re-worked and re-invented to fit into Tekken 7's world. This mod was made using @Kiloutre's Tekken Moveset Extractor, so huge props to him, it would have been impossible without his tool.

# Disclaimer
This moveset mod is based on Jun Kazama's TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT 2 moveset, designed and animated by Bandai Namco and the Tekken Project. This is only a fan-made moveset, made by replicating existing behaviors and animations from TEKKEN 7, game also designed and animated by Bandai Namco and the Tekken Project. Any resemblance or similarity with unannounced or unreleased content for TEKKEN 7 is purely coincidental. The mod has been tested and it's safe to use, but I do not take any responsibility for any harm or damage it may cause to your computer.

# How to use
This moveset mod was designed to be loaded with Tekken Moveset Extractor, being imported into memory in real-time. Installation is quite simple, just download the files and extract "7_JUN_KAZAMA_Vx.y.rar" content (x and y stand for version number and sub number) into the "extracted_chars" folder that's located inside the "Tekken Moveset Extractor" folder. Next, start the game, and once it's fully loaded, open the tool, select the moveset from the list, click "Set Online Local Player" and wait for the moveset to be loaded. Once it's done you can then select any game mode and any character you want and the moveset will be ready at the start of the match. The moveset works on any character, but I recommend using a standard size female such as Kazumi, Zafina or Asuka. Hitboxes may behave differently on bigger character models, and Rage Art camera activation effect also differs with each character, so keep that in mind. For more information about how to use the tool and how to play online with the mod, please visit https://github.com/Kiloutre/TekkenMovesetExtractor.

# Bug reports
The variants on this game are so big that it's almost impossible to test the moveset on/against every character on every circumstance and on every stage, so expect some bugs. If you happen to find any unexpected behaviors, please let me know so I can fix them for future updates. You can set up an issue here on Github or report/suggest stuff on Twitter using the hashtag `#tk7-junmoveset-report`. I'll be checking both sources on a daily basis.

# Donations
This mod is 100% free, but I'm setting up a link for those that really like the moveset and wish to contribute with a donation. I've been working really hard on this mod for almost 2 months, and I plan to keep updating it with balance changes / bug fixes for quite a while. Huge thanks in advance!
